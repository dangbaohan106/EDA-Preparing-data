# EDA and Data Preparation for Machine Learning

This project explores a typical workflow of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and structured data preprocessing in preparation for building machine learning models. It involves inspecting the dataset, cleaning and transforming variables, and generating meaningful features for model input.

## Project Overview

### 1. Remove outlier by using IQR  
### 2. Label encoding for each object data type

## Key Steps in the Notebook

- Data exploration and inspection of variable types  
- Handling missing values  
- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables  
- Normalizing and scaling numerical data  
- Preparing final datasets for modeling

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
